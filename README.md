Inorder to develop this page, I followed the steps mentioned on this link "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/".
First , I created the root folder and then installed all the  Global packages required.
Also added the react dependencies and plugins and created index.html , App.jsx , main.js and webpack.config.js.
Then created the application using html and css along with javascript.

HOW TO RUN :
execute the application using "npm start" command from the command prompt from inside the project folder.

I have developed a blog webpage based on Gaming related news.It has a 2 column layout which contains main blog content and a side navigation pane along with a header and footer.
